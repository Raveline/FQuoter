# FQuoter
## Current status
Coding. Come back later.
(Current progress : a bit below 50%, I'd say)

## Goal
* FQuoter is a simple command-line quotation manager.

* The idea is to be able to keep in a centralized place quotes from book you read.

* It keeps in a Sqlite database authors, books and quotes.

* Basically, it's really a simple way to manipulate quickly a database.

* It's also a good exercice for me to make a "real world" haskell application.
